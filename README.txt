---Setup Steps---

To start, run ServerGUI.jar to launch the the GUI that will control the server starting and stopping. To start the server, click 
the start button, and to stop the server, click the stop button.

The ServerGUI will display on it when a user has made a successful connection, when a user disconnects from the server, and when
a new game is started.

After running ServerGUI.jar, run Connect4.jar and enter the IP address of the server, and enter a username you would like to use.
If the IP address is incorrect, or if a username is not entered, a connection to the server will not be made. Once you have 
successfully connected to the server, you will be taken to the game screen and put into a waiting que until another user makes
a conenction to the server. You will then be paired with them and be able to start playing the game.

---Game Instructions---

To play the game, hover your cursor over a column and click on it to place a piece in that column. Once you have placed a piece, it
will be the other players turn to place a piece. The objective of the game is to get four pieces of your color in a chain either
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 

Once a win condition is met, both players will be told whether they won or lost, and will be propmted asking if they would like
to play again. If the "yes" button is selected, the game board will be reset and another game will start when there is another
player to be connected to. If the "no" button is selected, the player will be disconnected from the server and and the 
application will close.
